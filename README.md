# Intelligent Log Anomaly Detection

This project implements an intelligent system for detecting suspicious behavior in security logs using machine learning techniques.

## Motivation
Security teams deal with massive volumes of logs daily, making manual analysis inefficient and error-prone. This project aims to automate the detection of anomalous patterns that may indicate security incidents.

## Objectives
- Parse and preprocess security logs
- Establish a rule-based baseline for comparison
- Apply machine learning models for anomaly detection
- Compare traditional approaches with intelligent techniques

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Project Structure
- `data/`: raw and processed datasets
- `src/`: source code for parsing, feature extraction, and detection
- `notebooks/`: exploratory data analysis
- `results/`: evaluation metrics and outputs

## Methodology
1. Log collection and preprocessing  
2. Feature extraction from log data  
3. Baseline implementation using heuristic rules  
4. Machine learning-based anomaly detection  
5. Performance evaluation and comparison  

## Future Improvements
- Support for multiple log formats
- Real-time log processing
- Integration with SIEM platforms
